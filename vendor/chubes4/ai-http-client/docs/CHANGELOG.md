# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI HTTP Client library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.7] - 2025-11-28

### Removed

- **Inappropriate Build Script**: Removed `build.sh` as this is a Composer library, not a ZIP-distributed WordPress plugin. The script created unused ZIP artifacts that don't align with the library's distribution method.

### Changed

- **Composer Archive Exclusions**: Added `archive.exclude` configuration to `composer.json` to prevent documentation and development files from being included in Composer package installations, while keeping them visible in the GitHub repository.

### Technical Details

**Archive Exclusions Added:**
- `/docs` - User documentation (keeps GitHub visible, excludes from vendor/)
- `/.claude` - Development AI context files
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines
- `/README.md` - Repository documentation
- `/build.sh` - Removed build script

**Impact:**
- Composer users get clean vendor directories without documentation bloat
- GitHub repository maintains full documentation visibility
- Aligns distribution method with Composer library standards

## [2.0.6] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **BaseProvider Architecture**: Introduced `AI_HTTP_BaseProvider` abstract class centralizing common provider functionality including validation, sanitization, HTTP patterns, and Files API operations
- **Unified Provider Interface**: All providers now extend BaseProvider, ensuring consistent implementation patterns and reducing code duplication
- **Enhanced File Management**: Centralized file upload/delete operations with provider-specific implementations
- **Improved Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all providers with consistent error triggering and context

### Changed

- **Provider Refactoring**: All provider classes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter) refactored to extend BaseProvider
- **Code Consolidation**: Removed ~1700 lines of duplicated code across providers by leveraging inheritance
- **Initialization Order**: BaseProvider now loads first in ai-http-client.php to ensure proper class availability

### Technical Details

**New BaseProvider Features**:
- Abstract methods for provider-specific implementations (endpoints, formatting, authentication)
- Centralized request/response handling with unified error management
- Built-in Files API support with multipart upload capabilities
- Streaming request infrastructure with callback support
- Model fetching and normalization with caching integration

**Affected Files** (6 total):
- `/ai-http-client.php` - BaseProvider loading order
- `/src/Providers/BaseProvider.php` - NEW: Abstract base class
- `/src/Providers/anthropic.php` - Refactored to extend BaseProvider
- `/src/Providers/gemini.php` - Refactored to extend BaseProvider
- `/src/Providers/grok.php` - Refactored to extend BaseProvider
- `/src/Providers/openai.php` - Refactored to extend BaseProvider
- `/src/Providers/openrouter.php` - Refactored to extend BaseProvider

**No Functional Changes**: All AI provider functionality remains identical. This is purely an architectural improvement for maintainability and code consistency.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed

- **URL Encoding Bug**: Removed `sanitize_textarea_field()` from message content sanitization across all providers. This WordPress function was URL-encoding special characters in message content, corrupting structured data. Role sanitization retained; tool descriptions unchanged.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed

- **Streaming Request Bug**: Removed premature `curl_close()` call in streaming request function that was interrupting data transmission. Streaming requests now complete properly without connection interruption.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed

- **Multi-Plugin Compatibility**: Added initialization guard to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins include the AI HTTP Client library simultaneously. The library now properly handles being loaded by multiple plugins without losing provider registrations.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **Critical Fix**: Corrected function call in `Models.php` line 41 - changed `chubes_ai_http_generate_cache_key()` to `ai_http_generate_cache_key()` to match actual function definition
- **Context**: Utility functions use `ai_http_` prefix, while filter hooks use `chubes_ai_` prefix. The CHANGELOG entry in 2.0.0 incorrectly stated the function was renamed - only filter hooks were renamed, not utility functions.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-15

### Breaking Changes

**WordPress.org Compliance**: All filter/action hooks renamed from `ai_*` to `chubes_ai_*` prefix for WordPress Plugin Directory compliance and to prevent naming conflicts with other AI-related plugins.

#### Hook Migrations

**Filters**:
- `ai_providers` → `chubes_ai_providers`
- `ai_provider_api_keys` → `chubes_ai_provider_api_keys`
- `ai_models` → `chubes_ai_models`
- `ai_tools` → `chubes_ai_tools`
- `ai_request` → `chubes_ai_request`
- `ai_file_to_base64` → `chubes_ai_file_to_base64`
- `ai_http` → `chubes_ai_http`

**Actions**:
- `ai_http_client_loaded` → `chubes_ai_http_client_loaded`
- `ai_library_error` → `chubes_ai_library_error`
- `ai_clear_model_cache` → `chubes_ai_clear_model_cache`
- `ai_clear_all_cache` → `chubes_ai_clear_all_cache`
- `ai_model_cache_cleared` → `chubes_ai_model_cache_cleared`
- `ai_all_model_cache_cleared` → `chubes_ai_all_model_cache_cleared`

#### Storage Migrations

**WordPress Options**:
- `ai_http_shared_api_keys` → `chubes_ai_http_shared_api_keys` (auto-migrated)

**Cache Keys** (Transients):
- `ai_models_{provider}_{hash}` → `chubes_ai_models_{provider}_{hash}` (rebuilds automatically)

### Added

- **Automatic Migration System**: API keys are automatically migrated on first admin page load after upgrading to v2.0
- **Migration Tracking**: `chubes_ai_http_v2_migrated` option tracks migration completion
- **Scheduled Cleanup**: Old API keys option automatically deleted 30 days after migration

### Changed

- **Cache Key Constant**: `AIHttpCache::MODEL_CACHE_PREFIX` updated from `'ai_models_'` to `'chubes_ai_models_'`
- **Function Naming**: `ai_http_generate_cache_key()` renamed to `chubes_ai_http_generate_cache_key()`
- **Database Queries**: Transient pattern matching updated to use new `chubes_ai_models_*` pattern

### Migration Guide

#### For Plugin Developers

If your plugin uses the ai-http-client library, update all hook references:

```php
// OLD (v1.x)
$providers = apply_filters('ai_providers', []);
$models = apply_filters('ai_models', $provider);
$response = apply_filters('ai_request', $request);
add_filter('ai_tools', function($tools) { ... });

// NEW (v2.0)
$providers = apply_filters('chubes_ai_providers', []);
$models = apply_filters('chubes_ai_models', $provider);
$response = apply_filters('chubes_ai_request', $request);
add_filter('chubes_ai_tools', function($tools) { ... });
```

#### For End Users

**No manual intervention required**. API keys are automatically migrated when:
1. You visit any WordPress admin page after upgrading
2. The migration runs once and marks itself complete
3. Old API keys are preserved for 30 days, then automatically cleaned up

#### Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to v1.x within 30 days:
1. Downgrade library to v1.2.3
2. Delete the `chubes_ai_http_v2_migrated` option
3. Your original `ai_http_shared_api_keys` will still be intact
